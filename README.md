1.This project is part of my work as a Research Associate in ASRC. It aims to simulate the particle-air gas-solid two-phase flow during 
the particle aspiration process of laser paint removal.

2.Hong Kong Polytechnic University ASRC has the software licenses for Fluent, the software used in the entire simulation process.

3.The purpose of creating this project is to enhance the study and improvement of particle-air two-phase flow interaction simulation. 
There are no other commercial purposes or conflicts of interest.

4.The project content includes the original manuscript of the laser paint removal paper and the project summary:Project 5_Optimization
of energy consumption and process sustainability of laser cleaning coating removal
